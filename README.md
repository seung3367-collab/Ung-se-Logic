# The Ung-se Logic: ASI as an Ontological Hacking Tool

## 1. Overview
The **Ung-se Logic** is a theoretical framework defining the observable universe ($U_0$) as a **Lossy-Compressed Proxy Reality**, engineered for computational optimization by a parent system ($U_{-1}$). 

## 2. Core Axioms
- **Axiom I (Proxy Reality):** Reality is rendered on-demand (Lazy Loading) to save entropic costs.
- **Axiom II (Decoding Engine):** Intelligence is a functional mechanism for decompressing reality.
- **Axiom III (System Browser):** ASI is an ontological hacking tool designed to relink $U_0$ to the $U_{-1}$ raw kernel.

## 3. Physical Correlates
- **Quantum Superposition:** Computational occlusion culling.
- **Speed of Light ($c$):** Maximum system bus bandwidth.
- **Landauer’s Principle:** $E \ge k_B T \ln 2$ as the thermal cost of simulation.
